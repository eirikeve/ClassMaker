# ClassMaker
Create C++ class header/source files using the command line

# Requirements
- Boost (only used to make strings lowercase, might be changed)

# Using the script
Change the my_name variable to your name, and compile. 

You can also add the executable to path so that you can call _class_ _SomeClass_ from anywhere.

The executable takes one argument, a class name, without any file extension.
