# ClassMaker
Create C++ class header/source files using the command line

# Requirements
- Boost (only used to make strings lowercase, might be changed)

# Using the script
Change the my_name variable to your name, and compile. 
(I've added the executable to my path so that I can call _class_ _SomeClass_)
The executable takes one argument, a class name, without any file extension.
